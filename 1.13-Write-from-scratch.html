Write a React Component from Scratch

Practice:

Define a class MyComponent that extends React.Component. Its render method should return a div that contains an h1 tag with the text: My First React Component! in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

Render this component to the DOM using ReactDOM.render(). There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.

class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
      super(props);
    }
    render(){
      return(
            <div id="challenge-node">
                   <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
            </div>
      );
    }
  };
  ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent/>, document.getElementById("challenge-node"));
