Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount

Practice:

The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    componentWillMount() {
      // Change code below this line
    console.log('Component being mounted');
      // Change code above this line
    }
    render() {
      return <div />
    }
  };
