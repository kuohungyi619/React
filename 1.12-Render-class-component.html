Render a Class Component to the DOM

Practice:

Both the Fruits and Vegetables components are defined for you behind the scenes. Render both components as children of the TypesOfFood component, then render TypesOfFood to the DOM. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
          {/* change code below this line */}
          <Fruits />
          <Vegetables />
          {/* change code above this line */}
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
  
  // change code below this line
  ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood />, document.getElementById('challenge-node'))
