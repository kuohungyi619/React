Create a Complex JSX Element

Practice:

Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order:

An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you want within each element.

const JSX = <div>
    <h1>Heading.</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>
  </div>;
