Add Comments in JSX

Practice:

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
    {/*<h1>This is a comment</h1>*/}
  </div>
);
