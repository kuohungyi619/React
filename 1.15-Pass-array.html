Pass an Array as Props

Practice:

There are List and ToDo components in the code editor. When rendering each List from the ToDo component, pass in a tasks property assigned to an array of to-do tasks, for example ["walk dog", "workout"]. Then access this tasks array in the List component, showing its value within the p element. Use join(", ") to display the props.tasksarray in the p element as a comma separated list. Today's list should have at least 2 tasks and tomorrow's should have at least 3 tasks.

const List= (props) => {
    return <p>{props.tasks.join(', ')}</p>
  };
  
  class ToDo extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
          <h2>Today</h2>
          <List tasks={['study', 'exercise']} />
          <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
          <List tasks={['call Sam', 'grocery shopping', 'order tickets']} />
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
